# Inception User Guide

One of the steps often overlooked when delivering a project is the project inception or project visioning stage. This step takes the previous steps (project idea, expected outcomes and impact assessment) and ensures a shared understanding of what is needed in order to achieve the benefits. The diagram below details the potential activities that may occur during Inception. This phase ends when the team has developed a vision for the release that the stakeholders agree to and has obtained support for the rest of the project (or at least the next stage of it).
